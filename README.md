## 📂 Repository Contents

The top-level repository contains the following directories and notebooks:

* **Turkiye election_datas/** - Contains datasets and a notebook (election.ipynb) analysing the 2023 Turkish presidential election. The notebook cleans poorly labelled election results and merges them with provincial IQ and education-duration data to study how socio-economic indicators relate to candidates' vote shares. All analyses are non-political and are intended for educational purposes only.
* **Turkiye mean iq, education and divorce rates/** - Includes several CSV/Excel files on provincial IQ scores, education duration and divorce rates, plus a notebook (behavior.ipynb). The notebook explores correlations between average IQ, gender-parity indices, literacy rates and divorce rates across provinces.
* **basic-visualizations-for-student-lifestyle-data.ipynb** - A Kaggle-style notebook that loads a student lifestyle dataset and produces basic visualisations. The notebook uses heatmaps and scatter plots to examine relationships among study hours, GPA, stress levels, sleep and physical activity.
* **data-cleaning-challenge-handling-missing-values.ipynb** - Adapts Day 1 of Kaggle's Data Cleaning Challenge. It demonstrates techniques for identifying, quantifying, dropping and imputing missing values.
* **student-depression-dataset.ipynb** - Analyses a student mental-health dataset, comparing depression indicators between male and female students.
* **turkiye-mean-iq-education-and-divorce-rates.ipynb** - A variant of the `behavior` notebook that combines provincial IQ scores, education indicators and divorce statistics. It calculates correlation coefficients and visualises how IQ and education duration may relate to divorce rates.
* **data.csv (within Turkiye election_datas/)** - A compiled CSV summarising provincial election results alongside socio-economic indicators for further analysis.
