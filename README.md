# 📊 Data Visualization and Analysis Repository

Welcome to my **Data Visualization and Analysis Repository**!  
This repository contains a collection of data visualization and analysis projects created using open-source datasets.  

All data used in this repository has been sourced from publicly available, open sources and is intended solely for educational purposes.

Feel free to contribute or share your feedback to improve the projects.

## 📂 Repository Contents

The top-level repository contains the following directories and notebooks:

* [cite_start]**Turkiye election_datas/** - Contains datasets and a notebook (election.ipynb) analysing the 2023 Turkish presidential election[cite: 9]. [cite_start]The notebook cleans poorly labelled election results and merges them with provincial IQ and education-duration data to study how socio-economic indicators relate to candidates' vote shares[cite: 10]. [cite_start]All analyses are non-political and are intended for educational purposes only[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Turkiye mean iq, education and divorce rates/** - Includes several CSV/Excel files on provincial IQ scores, education duration and divorce rates, plus a notebook (behavior.ipynb)[cite: 12]. [cite_start]The notebook explores correlations between average IQ, gender-parity indices, literacy rates and divorce rates across provinces[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]**basic-visualizations-for-student-lifestyle-data.ipynb** - A Kaggle-style notebook that loads a student lifestyle dataset and produces basic visualisations[cite: 15]. [cite_start]The notebook uses heatmaps and scatter plots to examine relationships among study hours, GPA, stress levels, sleep and physical activity[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**data-cleaning-challenge-handling-missing-values.ipynb** - Adapts Day 1 of Kaggle's Data Cleaning Challenge[cite: 17]. [cite_start]It demonstrates techniques for identifying, quantifying, dropping and imputing missing values[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]**student-depression-dataset.ipynb** - Analyses a student mental-health dataset, comparing depression indicators between male and female students[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]**turkiye-mean-iq-education-and-divorce-rates.ipynb** - A variant of the `behavior` notebook that combines provincial IQ scores, education indicators and divorce statistics[cite: 24]. [cite_start]It calculates correlation coefficients and visualises how IQ and education duration may relate to divorce rates[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**data.csv (within Turkiye election_datas/)** - A compiled CSV summarising provincial election results alongside socio-economic indicators for further analysis[cite: 26].
